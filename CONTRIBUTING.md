# Contributing

## Contributions are welcomed

Pull requests for bug fixes are welcome, but before submitting new features or changes to current
functionality, please [open an issue](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-java/issues/new)
and discuss your ideas or propose the changes you wish to make first. After a resolution is reached a PR can be
submitted for
review.

When opening a pull request, please open it as
a [draft](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) to not auto assign reviewers before you feel
the pull request is in a reviewable state.

## Adding instrumentations

Check [Adding a New Instrumentation](docs/add_new_instrumentation.md) for instructions on adding a new instrumentation.

Check [How Instrumentations Work](docs/how_instrumentations_work.md) for a deep dive into how instrumentations work.

## Code contributions

### Development environment quick check

Prior to contributing to the project, you can quickly check your development environment using the `./setup.sh` command
line, and fix any issue found using the [Building documentation](BUILDING.md).

### Automatic code formatting

This project includes a `.editorconfig` file for basic editor settings.
This file is supported by most common text editors.

We have automatic code formatting enabled in Gradle configuration using [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless)
[Gradle plugin](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/master/plugin-gradle).
Main goal is to avoid extensive reformatting caused by different IDEs having different opinion about how things should
be formatted by establishing single _point of truth_.

To reformat all the files that need reformatting:

```bash
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

To run formatting verify task only:

```bash
./gradlew spotlessCheck
```

#### IntelliJ IDEA

For IntelliJ IDEA, we suggest the following settings and plugin:

In contrast to the [IntelliJ IDEA set up](CONTRIBUTING.md#intellij-idea) the default JVM to build and run tests from the
command line should be Java 8.

* Use Java 8 to build and run tests:  
  `Project Structure` > `Project` > `SDK` > Use a JDK 1.8
* Configure import formatting:  
  `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java/Groovy` > `Imports`
    * `Class count to use import with '*'`: `9999` (some number sufficiently large that is unlikely to matter)
    * `Names count to use static import with '*'`: `9999`
    * With java use the following import layout (groovy should still use the default) to ensure consistency with
      google-java-format:
      ![import layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/734411/43430811-28442636-94ae-11e8-86f1-f270ddcba023.png)
* [Google Java Format](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8527-google-java-format) plugin

### Git pre-commit hook

There is a pre-commit hook setup to verify formatting before committing. It can be activated with this command:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

### Git submodule setup

Git does not automatically update submodules when switching branches.

Add the following configuration setting, or you will need to remember to add `--recurse-submodules` to `git checkout`
when switching to old branches.

```bash
git config --local submodule.recurse true
```

This will keep the submodule in `dd-java-agent/agent-jmxfetch/integrations-core` up to date.

### Troubleshooting

* Gradle fails with a "too many open files" error.
    * You can check the `ulimit` for open files in your current shell by doing `ulimit -n` and raise it by
      calling `ulimit -n <new number>`

<details>
  <summary>More past issues</summary>

* When Gradle is building the project, the
  error `Could not find netty-transport-native-epoll-4.1.43.Final-linux-x86_64.jar` is shown.
    * Execute `rm -rf  ~/.m2/repository/io/netty/netty-transport*` in a Terminal and re-build again.

* IntelliJ 2021.3
  complains `Failed to find KotlinGradleProjectData for GradleSourceSetData` https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KTIJ-20173
    * Switch to `IntelliJ IDEA CE 2021.2.3`

* IntelliJ Gradle fails to import the project with `JAVA_11_HOME must be set to build Java 11 code`
    * A workaround is to run IntelliJ from terminal with `JAVA_11_HOME`
    * In order to verify what's visible from IntelliJ use `Add Configuration` bar and go
      to `Add New` -> `Gradle` -> `Environmental Variables`

</details>

## Running tests on another JVM

To run tests on a different JVM than the one used for doing the build, you need two things:

1) An environment variable pointing to the JVM to use on the form `JAVA_[JDKNAME]_HOME`,
   e.g. `JAVA_ZULU15_HOME`, `JAVA_GRAALVM17_HOME`

2) A command line option to the gradle task on the form `-PtestJvm=[JDKNAME]`,
   e.g. `-PtestJvm=ZULU15`, `-PtestJvm=GRAALVM17`

Please note that the JDK name needs to end with the JDK version, e.g. `11`, `ZULU15`, `ORACLE8`, `GRAALVM17`, etc.

## The APM test agent

The APM test agent emulates the APM endpoints of the Datadog Agent.
The APM Test Agent container runs alongside Java tracer Instrumentation Tests in CI,
handling all traces during test runs and performing a number of `Trace Checks`.
Trace Check results are returned within the `Get APM Test Agent Trace Check Results` step for all instrumentation test
jobs.
Check [trace invariant checks](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-apm-test-agent#trace-invariant-checks) for more
informations.

The APM Test Agent also emits helpful logging, including logging received traces' headers, spans, errors encountered,
ands information on trace checks being performed.
Logs can be viewed in CircleCI within the Test-Agent container step for all instrumentation test suites,
ie: `z_test_8_inst` job.
