# Contributing

Pull requests for bug fixes are welcome, but before submitting new features or changes to current
functionality [open an issue](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-java/issues/new)
and discuss your ideas or propose the changes you wish to make. After a resolution is reached a PR can be submitted for
review.

When opening a pull request, please open it as
a [draft](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) to not auto assign reviewers before you feel
the pull request is in a reviewable state.

## Requirements

To build the full project:

* JDK version 8 must be installed.
* JDK version 11 must be installed.
* JDK version 17 must be installed.
* JDK version 21 must be installed.
* `JAVA_8_HOME` must point to the JDK-8 location.
* `JAVA_11_HOME` must point to the JDK-11 location.
* `JAVA_17_HOME` must point to the JDK-17 location.
* `JAVA_21_HOME` must point to the JDK-21 location.
* The JDK-8 `bin` directory must be the only JDK on the PATH (e.g. `$JAVA_8_HOME/bin`).
* `JAVA_HOME` may be unset. If set, it must point to JDK-8 (same as `JAVA_8_HOME`).

MacOS users, remember that `/usr/libexec/java_home` may control which JDK is in your path.

In contrast to the [IntelliJ IDEA set up](#intellij-idea) the default JVM to build and run tests from the command line
should be Java 8.

There is no Oracle JDK v8 for ARM. ARM users might want to
use [Azul's Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-8-lts&architecture=arm-64-bit&package=jdk#zulu)
builds of Java 8. On macOS, they can be installed
using `brew tap homebrew/cask-versions && brew install --cask zulu8`. [Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/)
builds have also been proven to work.

# Building

To build the project without running tests run:

```bash
./gradlew clean assemble
```

To build the entire project with tests (this can take a very long time) run:

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

# Adding Instrumentations

See [Adding a New Instrumentation](./docs/add_new_instrumentation.md) for instructions on adding a new instrumentation.

See [How Instrumentations Work](./docs/how_instrumentations_work.md) for a deep dive into how instrumentations work.

# Automatic code formatting

This project includes a `.editorconfig` file for basic editor settings. This file is supported by most common text
editors.

We have automatic code formatting enabled in Gradle configuration using [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless)
[Gradle plugin](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/master/plugin-gradle).
Main goal is to avoid extensive reformatting caused by different IDEs having different opinion about how things should
be formatted by establishing single 'point of truth'.

To reformat all the files that need reformatting.

```bash
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

To run formatting verify task only.

```bash
./gradlew spotlessCheck
```

## Pre-commit hook

There is a pre-commit hook setup to verify formatting before committing. It can be activated with this command:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

## Git submodule setup

Git does not automatically update submodules when switching branches.

Add the following configuration setting, or you will need to remember to add `--recurse-submodules` to `git checkout`
when switching to old branches.

```bash
git config --local submodule.recurse true
```

This will keep the submodule in `dd-java-agent/agent-jmxfetch/integrations-core` up to date.

## Intellij IDEA

Compiler settings:

* OpenJDK 11 must be installed to build the entire project. Under `SDKs` it must have the name `11`.
* Under `Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Java Compiler` disable `Use '--release' option for cross-compilation`

Suggested plugins and settings:

* Editor > Code Style > Java/Groovy > Imports
    * Class count to use import with '*': `9999` (some number sufficiently large that is unlikely to matter)
    * Names count to use static import with '*': `9999`
    * With java use the following import layout (groovy should still use the default) to ensure consistency with
      google-java-format:
      ![import layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/734411/43430811-28442636-94ae-11e8-86f1-f270ddcba023.png)
* [Google Java Format](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8527-google-java-format)

## Troubleshooting

* When Gradle is building the project, the
  error `Could not find netty-transport-native-epoll-4.1.43.Final-linux-x86_64.jar` is shown.
    * Execute `rm -rf  ~/.m2/repository/io/netty/netty-transport*` in a Terminal and re-build again.

* IntelliJ 2021.3
  complains `Failed to find KotlinGradleProjectData for GradleSourceSetData` https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KTIJ-20173
    * Switch to `IntelliJ IDEA CE 2021.2.3`

* IntelliJ Gradle fails to import the project with `JAVA_11_HOME must be set to build Java 11 code`
    * A workaround is to run IntelliJ from terminal with `JAVA_11_HOME`
    * In order to verify what's visible from IntelliJ use `Add Configuration` bar and go
      to `Add New` -> `Gradle` -> `Environmental Variables`

* Gradle fails with a "too many open files" error.
    * You can check the `ulimit` for open files in your current shell by doing `ulimit -n` and raise it by
      calling `ulimit -n <new number>`

## Running tests on another JVM

To run tests on a different JVM than the one used for doing the build, you need two things:

1) An environment variable pointing to the JVM to use on the form `JAVA_[JDKNAME]_HOME`,
   e.g. `JAVA_ZULU15_HOME`, `JAVA_GRAALVM17_HOME`

2) A command line option to the gradle task on the form `-PtestJvm=[JDKNAME]`,
   e.g. `-PtestJvm=ZULU15`, `-PtestJvm=GRAALVM17`

Please note that the JDK name needs to end with the JDK version, e.g. `11`, `ZULU15`, `ORACLE8`, `GRAALVM17`, etc.

## The APM Test Agent

The APM test agent emulates the APM endpoints of the Datadog Agent. The Test Agent container runs alongside Java tracer
Instrumentation Tests in CI, handling all traces during test runs and performing a number of `Trace Checks`. Trace
Check results are returned within the `Get APM Test Agent Trace Check Results` step for all instrumentation test jobs.

For more information on Trace Checks, see:
https://github.com/DataDog/dd-apm-test-agent#trace-invariant-checks

The APM Test Agent also emits helpful logging, including logging received traces' headers, spans, errors encountered,
ands information on trace checks being performed. Logs can be viewed in CircleCI within the Test-Agent container step
for all instrumentation test suites, ie: `z_test_8_inst` job
