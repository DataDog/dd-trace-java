# Contributing

## Contributions are welcomed

Pull requests for bug fixes are welcome, but before submitting new features or changes to current
functionality, please [open an issue](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-java/issues/new)
and discuss your ideas or propose the changes you wish to make first. After a resolution is reached, a [PR can be
submitted](#pull-request-guidelines) for review.

## Adding instrumentations

Check [Adding a New Instrumentation](docs/add_new_instrumentation.md) for instructions on adding a new instrumentation.

Check [How Instrumentations Work](docs/how_instrumentations_work.md) for a deep dive into how instrumentations work.

## Code contributions

### Development environment quick check

Prior to contributing to the project, you can quickly check your development environment using the `./setup.sh` command
line and fix any issue found using the [Building documentation](BUILDING.md).

### Automatic code formatting

This project includes a `.editorconfig` file for basic editor settings.
This file is supported by most common text editors.

We have automatic code formatting enabled in Gradle configuration using [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless)
[Gradle plugin](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/master/plugin-gradle).
Our main goal is to avoid extensive reformatting caused by different IDEs with different opinions about how things should
be formatted by establishing a single _point of truth_.

To reformat all the files that need reformatting:

```bash
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

To run the formatting verify task only:

```bash
./gradlew spotlessCheck
```

#### IntelliJ IDEA

For IntelliJ IDEA, we suggest the following settings and plugin.

The default JVM to build and run tests from the command line should be Java 8.

* Use Java 8 to build and run tests:
  * `Project Structure` -> `Project` -> `SDK` -> `Download JDK...` -> `Version: 1.8` -> `Download`
* Configure Java and Groovy import formatting:  
  * `Settings...` ->`Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java` > `Imports`
    * `Class count to use import with '*'`: `9999` (some number sufficiently large that is unlikely to matter)
    * `Names count to use static import with '*'`: `9999`
    * Use the following import layout to ensure consistency with google-java-format:
      ![import layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/734411/43430811-28442636-94ae-11e8-86f1-f270ddcba023.png)
  * top right Settings icon -> `Settings...` ->`Editor` > `Code Style` > `Groovy` > `Imports`
    * `Class count to use import with '*'`: `9999` (some number sufficiently large that is unlikely to matter)
    * `Names count to use static import with '*'`: `9999`
* Install the [Google Java Format](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8527-google-java-format) plugin

### Troubleshooting

* Gradle fails with a "too many open files" error.
    * You can check the `ulimit` for open files in your current shell by running `ulimit -n`.
    * You can raise the `ulimit` by running `ulimit -n <new number>`

<details>
  <summary>Past issues</summary>

* When Gradle is building the project, the
  error `Could not find netty-transport-native-epoll-4.1.43.Final-linux-x86_64.jar` is shown.
    * Execute `rm -rf  ~/.m2/repository/io/netty/netty-transport*` in a Terminal and re-build.

* IntelliJ 2021.3
  complains `Failed to find KotlinGradleProjectData for GradleSourceSetData` https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KTIJ-20173.
    * Switch to `IntelliJ IDEA CE 2021.2.3`.

* IntelliJ Gradle fails to import the project with `JAVA_11_HOME must be set to build Java 11 code`.
    * A workaround is to run IntelliJ from your terminal with `JAVA_11_HOME`.
    * In order to verify what's visible from IntelliJ, use the `Add Configuration` bar and go
      to `Add New` -> `Gradle` -> `Environmental Variables`.

## Pull request guidelines

### Draft first

When opening a pull request, please open it as a [draft](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) to not auto-assign reviewers before the pull request is in a reviewable state.

### Title format

Pull request titles should briefly describe the proposed changes in a way that makes sense for the users.
They should be a sentence starting with an infinitive verb and avoid using prefixes like `[PROD]` or `PROD - ` in favor of [labels](#labels).

>[!CAUTION]
> Don't title:
> * _Another bug fix_: it doesn't describe the change 
> * _Span sampling bug fix_: it doesn't start with an infinite verb
> * _Fix off-by-one error from rule parsing_: it doesn't make sense for the user
> * _[CORE] Fix span sampling rule parsing_: it doesn't use label for component tagging
> * _Fix span sampling rule parsing when using both remote config and property config_: it doesn't fit and will be cut during changelog generation

>[!TIP]
> Do instead: _Fix span sampling rule parsing_

>[!NOTE]
> If the changes don't make sense for the users, add the [`tag: no release note` label](#labels).

### Labels

GitHub labels applies to issues and pull requests.
They are used to identify the related components using [the `comp: ` category](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-java/labels?q=comp%3A) or instrumentations using [the `inst: ` category](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-java/labels?q=inst%3A).

Both pull requests and issues should be labelled with at least a component or an instrumentation, in addition to the type of changes using [the `type: ` category](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-java/labels?q=type).

>[!TIP]
> Always add a `comp:` or `inst:` label, and a `type:` label. 

Labels are used to not only categorize but also alter the continuous integration behavior:

* `tag: no release note` to exclude a pull request from the next release changelog. Use it when changes are not relevant to the users like:
  * Internal features changes
  * Refactoring pull requests
  * CI and build tools improvements
  * Minor changes like typo
* [The `run-tests:` category](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-java/labels?q=run-tests%3A) to run continuous integration tests on a specific JVM in case of JVM specific changes
* `run-tests: flaky` to run the flaky tests on continuous integration as they are disabled by default

>[!NOTE]
> For reference, the [full list of all labels available](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-java/labels).
> If you feel one is missing, let [the maintainer team](https://github.com/orgs/DataDog/teams/apm-java) know!

## Pull request reviews

### Review expectations

After making your pull request ready for review by converting it from a draft, you can expect to get an initial review comment within two working days and a full review within a week of work.
If you don't receive any update, feel free to send a nice reminder to the assigned reviewers using pull request comments or our internal Slack channel.

### Stale pull requests

A pull request is considered "stale" if it has had no activity (comments, updates) for the last quarter.
Stale PRs will be commented and labeled as such (using the `tag: stale` label), and then closed if they receive no update after a week.

Closed PRs can be reopened at any time, but they may be closed again if they meet the same stale conditions.
