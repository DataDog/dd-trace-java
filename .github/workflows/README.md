## Maintenance

GitHub actions should be part of the [repository allowed actions to run](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-java/settings/actions).
While GitHub owned actions are allowed by default, the other ones must be declared.

Run the following script to get the list of actions to declare according the state of your working copy:
```bash
find .github/workflows -name "*.yaml" -exec  awk '/uses:/{print $2 ","}' {} \; | grep -vE '^(actions|github)/' | sort | uniq
```
