## Maintenance

GitHub actions should be part of the [repository allowed actions to run](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-java/settings/actions).
While GitHub owned actions are allowed by default, the other ones must be declared.

Run the following script to get the list of actions to declare according the state of your working copy:
```bash
find .github/workflows -name "*.yaml" -exec  awk '/uses:/{print $2 ","}' {} \; | grep -vE '^(actions|github)/' | sort | uniq
```

## Testing

Workflows can be locally tested using the [`act` CLI](https://github.com/nektos/act/).
The [.github/workflows/tests/](./tests) folder contains test scripts and event payloads to locally trigger workflows.

> [!WARNING]
> Locally running workflows will still query GitHub backend and will update the GitHub project accordingly.
> Pay extra attention to the workflow jobs you trigger to not create development disruption.
