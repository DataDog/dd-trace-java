    <!-- When running the embedded GlassFish in tests, with delegation, the webapp classloader loads LoggerFactory
    * (in slf4j-api) from the system classloader (Gradle's copy); LoggerFactory then attempts to load StaticLoggerBinder
    * (in logback-class) from the classloader that loaded it (the system classloader) and can't find it, since it's only
    * in the war, and accessible from the webapp classloader only. Adding a system classloader dep on logback-classic is
    * no solution since then the configuration file logback.xml would still not be found.
    * So disable delegation so that LoggerFactory is loaded from the slf4j copy in the war. -->
