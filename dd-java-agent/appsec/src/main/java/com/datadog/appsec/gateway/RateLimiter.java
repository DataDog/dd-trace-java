/**
 * Rate limiter that applies a limit of operations per second. It stores the count for the current
 * second and the count for the previous second. It checks that the total count, defined as the
 * number of counts for the current second plus (1 - elapsed fraction of current second) * previous
 * second count, does not exceed a set limit.
 *
 * <p>The state is stored in a single 64-bit number, so that it can be updated atomically in an
 * efficient manner. The least significant 20 bits are reserved to the current second count, the
 * next 20 bits to the previous second count, and the most significant 24-bits for the time of the
 * last update.
 *
 * <p>The fact that only 24-bits are used for the time, and therefore that the time wraps around
 * every 2^24 seconds (~194 days) results in that ew might erroneously think that the last update
 * was done in the current second, when in fact it was done 194 days before. This could be used by
 * an attacker to force throttling by performing their attacks in a 1-second span every 194 days.
 * However, for this to work, the server would have to get no other events by other users in this
 * same time span.
