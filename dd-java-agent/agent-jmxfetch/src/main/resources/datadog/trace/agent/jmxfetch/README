# Metric Configs

Files from [integrations-core](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/search?q=jmx_metrics&unscoped_q=jmx_metrics)
are copied here at build time by the `copy-metric-configs.sh` script which is called by gradle after initializing the submodule.

These are then bundled in `dd-java-agent.jar`. Due to limitations in Java, it is non-trivial
to get all these files from within the jar without knowing their names.
Consequently, we list out each integration in `metricconfigs.txt` so the agent can reference them.
