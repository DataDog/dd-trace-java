This is a test-only project. There is no new instrumentation here.

Mongo has several client libraries and they can not be selectively used in one project.

This project is running tests using the `mongodb-driver-async`, version 3.3-3.12. Mongo 3.12 is the last version where `mongodb-driver-async` is available.
