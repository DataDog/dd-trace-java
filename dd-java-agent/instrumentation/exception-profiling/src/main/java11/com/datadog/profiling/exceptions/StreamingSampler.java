/**
 * A streaming (non-remembering) sampler.
 *
 * <p>The sampler attempts to generate at most N samples per fixed time window in randomized
 * fashion. For this it divides the timeline into 'sampling windows' of constant duration. Each
 * sampling window targets a constant number of samples which are scattered randomly (uniform
 * distribution) throughout the window duration and once the window is over the real stats of
 * incoming events and the number of gathered samples is used to recompute the target probability to
 * use in the following window.
 *
 * <p>This will guarantee, if the windows are not excessively large, that the sampler will be able
 * to adjust to the changes in the rate of incoming events.
 *
 * <p>However, there might so rapid changes in incoming events rate that we will optimistically use
 * all allowed samples well before the current window has elapsed or, on the other end of the
 * spectrum, there will be to few incoming events and the sampler will not be able to generate the
 * target number of samples.
 *
 * <p>To smooth out these hicups the sampler maintains an under-sampling budget which can be used to
 * compensate for too rapid changes in the incoming events rate and maintain the target average
 * number of samples per window.
