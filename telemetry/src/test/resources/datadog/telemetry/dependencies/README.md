These are mostly original pubic libraries for which most files were removed to
leave only the manifest.

In `groovy-no-manifest-info.jar`, the manifest was also removed. `junit.zip` is
a plain zip file to which the file `junit-4.12.jar` was added.
`spring-boot-app.jar` is the stripped jar generated from [this
application](https://github.com/DataDog/system-tests/tree/03b430a5499a0ad647262db93ba3c41c776470fb/utils/build/docker/java/spring-boot)
(built with `mvn package`).
